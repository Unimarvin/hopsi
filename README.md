# hopsi
A tool for homogeneous algebraic P-equations and P-inequalities.

Hopsi computes a linear representation of the solution space
of homogeneous equations and inequalities. Here, the analysis is restricted
to data schemes over a single sort and identity as congruence, resulting in
the Herbrand structure.

The tool is part of the phD thesis "Preserving data integrity in distributed systems" written by Marvin Triebel.

# Acknowledgement
Hopsi was designed, programmed and analyzed by Arthur Bartels as his Student project at the chair Theory of programming of the department of computer science at the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin.

## remarks on name
Hopsi was originally named "NOPSI". Accordingly, some files and classes may still use the old name.

# Getting Started
For getting, use java to run the jar file from the directory bin. The folder testfiles gives several examples for running the tool.

# Compile
To recompile the code, you can use the Makefile with the default target.
